For optimisation and design of network graphs, many different algorithms can be used. In this course project, three network routing algorithms are implemented which solves the problem of finding maximum bandwidth path in the network for given source and destination nodes. Extensive use of data structures were made in the design of these algorithms. Lastly the results of all the three algorithms were compared in terms of their running time and maximum bandwidth path so obtained. The validation of the algorithms were done with five graph generations with five pairs of source and destination nodes for each graph.
